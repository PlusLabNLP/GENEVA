Damaging	Damaging			An Agent affects a Patient in such a way that the Patient (or some Subregion of the Patient) ends up in a non-canonical state.  Often this non-canonical state is undesirable, and some lexical units (marked with the Negative semantic type) specifically indicate that the Patient is negatively affected.  Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v).

Communication	Chatting			A group of people (the Interlocutors or Interlocutor_1 and Interlocutor_2 together) have a conversation.  No person is construed as only a speaker or only an addressee. Rather, it is understood that both (or all) participants do some speaking and some listening--the process is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal.  In this frame, the purpose of the conversation is generally social, rather than specifically to decide something or exchange information, or to quarrel (see Discussion and Quarreling).				
		Core	Interlocutor_1	The individual or individuals that form the more prominent (i.e. agentive) party of a conversation, as compared with Interlocutor_2. That is, Interlocutor_1 is generally encoded as the External Argument of verbs, and peripheral FEs that do not make reference to the event itself generally make reference to Interlocutor_1.  Thus a Purpose (or Means, Depictive, or Manner) is construed to be that of Interlocutor_1, not necessarily that of Interlocutor_2 or the group of Interlocutors as a whole.		3	Speaker

	Contacting			A Communicator (whose Location may be indicated) directs a Communication to an Addressee at a particular Address.  Note that no actual successful communicative act is implied, only the successful completion of acts which would establish the communication.  (In other words, Mari can e-mail Jon without Jon ever reading it.) NB:  The Address or Location_of_communicator may be a virtual address, such as an e-mail or telephone number.Disgruntled voters phoned Congressman Neil at his Washington residence with complaints about the recent increases in corporate welfare.She tried to call from the payphone down the street.

		Non-Core	Duration	The Duration of the conversation.		0		
		Core	Interlocutors	In some sentences both participants are expressed by the Subject, and there is no 'with'-phrase (cf example 1). In sentences like this, the Subject is assigned the FE role Interlocutors. In such sentences, the Subject always denotes more than one person, and it is understood that the reciprocal communication takes place between these two (or more) people. The Subject may denote two or more people either through conjunction, as in example 1, or through plurality, as in example 2, or by denoting a group, as in example 3. In each of these cases the FE Interlocutors is assigned. Notice that for nouns in the Discussion frame, it is possible for the Interlocutors role to be expressed by a prepositional phrase as in example 4.		3	Interlocutors

		Core	Interlocutor_1	In cases where the Interlocutors involved in a conversation are construed as two separate groups with different levels of volitionality or control, this FE identifies the conversational participant with greater semantic and syntactic prominence, as compared with Interlocutor_2. That is, Interlocutor_1 is generally encoded as Subject, and peripheral FEs that do not make reference to the event itself generally make reference to Interlocutor_1.  Thus a Purpose (or Means, Depictive, or Manner) is construed to be that of Interlocutor_1, not necessarily that of Interlocutor_2 or the group of Interlocutors as a whole.		3	Speaker	
		Non-Core	Place	The location at which a discussion takes place.		1		1
		Core	Interlocutor_2	In cases where the Interlocutors involved in a conversation are construed as two separate groups with different levels of volitionality or control, Interlocutor_2 refers to the semantically and grammatically less prominent group.  It is generally encoded within a prepositional phrase (e.g. headed by with).  Note that it is possible for a single role to correspond to multiple referents. For example, if the prepositional object in the example below were plural, we would still assign it the single role Interlocutor_2.		3	Addressee	
		Core	Topic	Topic expresses the subject that the Interlocutors are trying to come to some agreement about.  It may refer, for example, to an undesirable issue that the Interlocutors want to have the proper response to, or it may refer more directly to an unresolved question.		3	Topic
